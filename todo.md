P1

* we should make it so if you match too many players we don't allow it, but we also allow to match players who aren't in the grid, so we aren't giving away info.
* move the "played today" flag from local storage into kvstore so players can't fudge it.
* rarity thing doesn't work.
    * another option to try is "how few teams other than the ones listed did they play for.
* share link functionality.
* original Jets WPG1 isn't right.

P2
* maybe better auto-complete, some people couldn't figure that out.

P3

* ads
* Martin St. Louis
* mobile friendly, seeing all 8 teams at once
* requirements, like nationality, position, etc.
